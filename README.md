# One Piece Manga Web App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The One Piece Manga Webapp is dedicated to delivering a user-friendly interface and seamless experience for One Piece Manga enthusiasts. Unlike other generic manga websites, this project focuses solely on providing One Piece chapters to its readers.

To simplify the chapter-searching process, the webapp features a convenient "Latest Chapter" button, which enables users to quickly check and read when a new chapter has been released. My ultimate goal is to enhance the overall experience of One Piece readers, providing a dedicated platform where they can immerse themselves in their favorite manga series. 

Feel more than welcome to download and run the webapp yourself!

### Notes
  Initially, the plan was to host this project on GitHub Pages as I did for my portfolio. However, during deployment, the server.js file encountered an issue in fetching images from user requests due to a lack of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). To ensure compatibility with the website's standards, the server.js file needed to be configured properly, leading to a halt in the hosting process. However, as my primary objective was to create an app with a backend, I ultimately decided to focus on achieving that goal. 
  
  I was succsessful in creating my first REST-API using packages installed from NPM and then applied in javascript. Along the way I learned how to:
   -   Scrape data with the 'Cheerio' package
   -   Making user-defined requests to URLs and recieving responses using the 'Request' package
   -   Filtering HTML document responses from HTTP requests
   -   Enhancing my understanding of UI and UX design.
